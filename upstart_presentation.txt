# running a controlled service with upstart...

so daemons.  Not these demons, or these, but these.

back in the olden days, we used init.d

now we can use *upstart*

# http://docs.python.org/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.simple_server
# wsgi demo


so here is the code... a http web service that gives amanzing animal facts,
    some of which are true

(you know about tmux right?)


pre run
auto start.
kill it and respawn

'start/stop'

singleton


man 5 init


includes pre-stop,pre-start, chroot, chown


'''
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server, demo_app

httpd = make_server('', 8000, demo_app)
print "Serving HTTP on port 8000..."

# Respond to requests until process is killed
httpd.serve_forever()

# Alternative: serve one request, then exit
httpd.handle_request()
'''

$ curl 'localhost:8000'


sys
import time
import urllib2

while True:
    try:
        print urllib2.urlopen('http://localhost:8000',timeout=.5).read().split('\n')[0]
        sys.stdout.flush()
    except urllib2.URLError, exc:
        print exc
    
    time.sleep(.5)



The difference between serivces and daemons is complicated

(text:  I don't really understand daemons or services)
(text:  hopefully, I won't need to.)


man 5 init


# seems like you need to actually copy
sudo cp ~/gits/upstart_demo/upstart_demo_server.conf .
sudo tail -F /tmp/upstart.log


gregg@li119-89:/etc/init$ sudo /sbin/start upstart_demo_server
upstart_demo_server start/running, process 3109
